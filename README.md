# Express.js: Note Taker
 
## Description

The assignment is to modify existing code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. The application is to use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. The application’s front end has already been created and the task is to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.
